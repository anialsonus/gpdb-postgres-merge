# GPDB_91_MERGE_FIXME: GPDB acquires ExclusiveLock for update and delete SQL
# statements.  This invalidates most of the isolation tests from upstream below.
# E.g. an UPDATE step executed by isolationtester never returns because another
# session run in the same permutation holds ExclusiveLock that blocks the step.
# GPDB_94_MERGE_FIXME: Since the introduction of Global Deadlock Detector, an
# UPDATE/DELETE no longer acquires ExclusiveLock. So we could perhaps enable
# some of these now.
# GPDB_94_MERGE_FIXME: But SELECT FOR UPDATE still acquires a whole-table
# ExclusiveLock. Why?
# GPDB_95_MERGE_FIXME: insert-conflict-do-update-3 fails because ExclusiveLock
# is taken for same reason as above GPDB_94_MERGE_FIXME
# GPDB_95_MERGE_FIXME: insert-conflict-do-nothing and insert-conflict-do-update
# fail because isolationtester does not include QEs when checking pg_locks. If
# we are able to add the QE backend pids of gang to this list then these tests
# can be enabled.
